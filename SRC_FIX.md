# MISSING SRC DIRECTORY FIX

The Netlify build is now failing with:

```
Could not find a required file.
  Name: index.js
  Searched in: /opt/build/repo/sloane-frontend-package/src
```

## Problem
The `src` directory with index.js and App.jsx is not being tracked in git.

## Solution

Run these commands to add the src directory to git:

```bash
cd /Users/Mike/Desktop/clean-code/
git add -f sloane-frontend-package/src/
git commit -m "Add src directory with index.js, App.jsx and other source files"
git push origin main
```

Then trigger a new build in Netlify.

## Verification
After making this change, verify the build logs show the src directory is found.
