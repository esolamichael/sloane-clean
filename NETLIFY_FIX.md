# CRITICAL NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT FIX

The Netlify deployment is failing due to an error in the **Netlify dashboard settings**, not in the netlify.toml file.

## The Issue

The error message shows:
```
line 56: Unknown command "ruh" was used in the build script
```

This indicates there is a typo in the build command in the Netlify dashboard. The command is likely set to `npm ruh build` instead of `npm run build`.

## How to Fix

1. Log into the Netlify dashboard: https://app.netlify.com/
2. Go to your site settings
3. Navigate to the "Build & deploy" section
4. Under "Build settings", edit the "Build command"
5. Change `npm ruh build` to `npm run build`
6. Save the changes
7. Trigger a new deployment

## Verifying the Fix

After making the change, trigger a new build and check the build logs to ensure there are no more errors related to the "ruh" command.

## Additional Notes

- The netlify.toml file in the repository is correct but may be overridden by dashboard settings
- If you're using a CI/CD integration, make sure the correct command is used there as well
- After fixing this issue, the frontend should deploy successfully
