# CRITICAL NETLIFY BUILD FIX

The Netlify build is failing with:

```
Could not find a required file.  
Name: index.html
Searched in: /opt/build/repo/sloane-frontend-package/public
```

## Problem
The `public` directory with index.html and other files is not being properly tracked in git.

## Solution

1. Run these commands to add the public directory to git:

```bash
cd /Users/Mike/Desktop/clean-code/
git add -f sloane-frontend-package/public/
git commit -m "Add public directory with index.html"
git push origin main
```

2. Then go to Netlify dashboard and trigger a new build.

## Verification
After making this change, verify the build logs show the public directory is found.

This fixes the core issue of the missing index.html file that's causing the build to fail.
