# BACKEND DEPLOYMENT FIX

The App Engine deployment is failing in the Cloud Build step.

## Simplified Solution

I've created an absolutely minimal Flask app that should deploy without any issues:

1. `minimal_app.py` - An extremely simple Flask application
2. `minimal_app.yaml` - A minimal App Engine configuration

## Deploying the Minimal App

Run these commands in Google Cloud Shell:

```bash
# Go to your repository
cd sloane-clean

# Pull the latest changes
git pull origin main

# Deploy the minimal app
gcloud app deploy minimal_app.yaml
```

## After Successful Deployment

Once the minimal app is deployed and working, you can:

1. Verify it works by visiting: https://clean-code-app-1744825963.uc.r.appspot.com
2. Check the logs to see if there are any specific errors: `gcloud app logs tail`
3. Gradually add more functionality to the minimal app

## Common Deployment Issues

If deployment fails, check for these common issues:

1. Make sure all required APIs are enabled:
   ```bash
   gcloud services enable appengine.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com secretmanager.googleapis.com
   ```

2. Check if there are quota issues or billing problems:
   ```bash
   gcloud app regions list
   ```

3. Try a direct deployment without Cloud Build:
   ```bash
   gcloud app deploy minimal_app.yaml --no-cloud-build
   ```

4. If needed, recreate the App Engine application:
   ```bash
   gcloud app create --region=us-central
   ```
