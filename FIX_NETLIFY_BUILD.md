# CRITICAL FIX FOR NETLIFY BUILD FAILURE

The Netlify build is failing with the error: `Unknown command "ruh" was used in the build script`

## Exact Error
```
line 56: Unknown command "ruh" was used in the build script, causing the build to fail with exit code 1 [#L64]
```

## The Solution

This indicates the Netlify dashboard has a misconfigured build command that's trying to use `npm ruh build` instead of `npm run build`.

### Option 1: Fix in Netlify Dashboard (RECOMMENDED)

1. Log into Netlify dashboard: https://app.netlify.com/
2. Go to the site settings for your app
3. Under "Build & deploy" > "Build settings"
4. Change the "Build command" from `npm ruh build` to `npm run build`
5. Save changes
6. Trigger a new deploy

### Option 2: Use netlify.toml (Already Implemented)

I've changed the netlify.toml configuration to:

```toml
[build]
  base = "sloane-frontend-package"
  publish = "build"
  command = "./netlify/build.sh"
```

This uses the existing build.sh script which already has the correct command.

### Verification

After making these changes, the build should succeed without the "Unknown command "ruh"" error.
