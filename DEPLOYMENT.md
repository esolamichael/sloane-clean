# Deployment Instructions

## Backend (Google App Engine)

The backend is deployed to Google App Engine. Follow these instructions:

### Simplified Deployment Using Google Cloud Shell (Recommended)

1. Open Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Make sure you're in the "Clean Code App" project
3. Click the Cloud Shell icon (>_) in the top right corner
4. In Cloud Shell, clone your repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/esolamichael/sloane-clean.git
   cd sloane-clean
   ```
5. Run the deployment script:
   ```
   bash deploy.sh
   ```
6. The application will be deployed to: https://clean-code-app-1744825963.uc.r.appspot.com

### Manual Deployment Steps

If you prefer to deploy manually:

1. Open Google Cloud Console and launch Cloud Shell
2. Clone your repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/esolamichael/sloane-clean.git
   cd sloane-clean
   ```
3. Make sure the right APIs are enabled:
   ```
   gcloud services enable appengine.googleapis.com
   gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com
   gcloud services enable secretmanager.googleapis.com
   ```
4. Deploy to App Engine:
   ```
   gcloud app deploy app.yaml --quiet
   ```
5. Check the logs to verify deployment:
   ```
   gcloud app logs tail
   ```

### Option 2: Service Account Authentication (Better for CI/CD)

1. Install and initialize Google Cloud SDK as in Option 1 steps 1-5

2. Download a service account key from Google Cloud Console
   - Go to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts
   - Create or select an existing service account with App Engine Admin role
   - Create a new JSON key and download it
   - Secure this key file - don't commit it to version control!

3. Store your service account key in Secret Manager:
   ```
   # Create the secret
   gcloud secrets create app-service-account-key --replication-policy="automatic"
   
   # Add the key file
   gcloud secrets versions add app-service-account-key --data-file=PATH_TO_YOUR_KEY_FILE.json
   
   # Also store other sensitive values
   gcloud secrets create mongodb-connection --replication-policy="automatic"
   echo -n "YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING" | gcloud secrets versions add mongodb-connection --data-file=-
   
   gcloud secrets create twilio-auth-token --replication-policy="automatic"
   echo -n "YOUR_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN" | gcloud secrets versions add twilio-auth-token --data-file=-
   ```
   
4. Authenticate with the service account:
   ```
   gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=PATH_TO_YOUR_KEY_FILE.json
   ```

4. Set the project and deploy:
   ```
   gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
   gcloud app deploy app.yaml --quiet --no-cache
   ```

5. The application will be deployed to: https://PROJECT_ID.uc.r.appspot.com

### Required Secrets in Secret Manager

The following secrets **MUST** be set up in Google Cloud Secret Manager:

- `MONGODB_URL`: The MongoDB connection string
- `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`: API key for Google Maps Places API
- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`: Auth token for Twilio integration

#### Setting Up Secrets in Secret Manager

1. Go to Security â†’ Secret Manager in the Google Cloud Console
2. Click "Create Secret"
3. Enter the secret name exactly as shown above
4. Add the secret value
5. Click "Create Secret"

#### Giving App Engine Access to Secrets

After creating the secrets, you must give the App Engine service account permission to access them:

1. Go to each secret in Secret Manager
2. Click "Add Member"
3. Add the App Engine service account: `[PROJECT_ID]@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`
4. Assign the role "Secret Manager Secret Accessor"

This step is **CRITICAL**. Without these permissions, the application will fail to access the secrets.

### Important CORS Notes

The backend has been configured with proper CORS settings to allow connections from any origin. The key settings are:

1. CORS headers in the Flask application
2. Special handling for OPTIONS preflight requests

If you need to debug CORS issues:
- Check browser dev tools Network tab for CORS errors
- Review the server logs with: `gcloud app logs tail`

## Frontend (Netlify)

The frontend is automatically deployed when changes are pushed to the GitHub repository. The deployment is configured with Netlify's continuous deployment.

1. Changes to the `main` branch trigger a new build on Netlify
2. Netlify builds the React application using the build command in `netlify.toml`
3. The application is deployed to: https://sloane-ai-phone.netlify.app

### Important Configuration Notes

The frontend is configured to connect to the backend using direct API calls with proper CORS settings. There are several key configuration files:

1. `netlify.toml` - Main Netlify configuration
2. `public/_redirects` - URL redirect rules for Netlify

These rules enable proper routing for:
- API calls to the backend
- Frontend routing for React single-page application

## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend through several API endpoints:

- `/api/business/scrape-website` - Scrape website data during onboarding
- `/api/business/scrape-gbp` - Scrape Google Business Profile data during onboarding

These endpoints require the `X-Business-ID` header for authentication. They allow CORS from all origins to simplify development and deployment.
