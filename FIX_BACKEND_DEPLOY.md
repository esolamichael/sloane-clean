# CRITICAL FIX FOR APP ENGINE DEPLOYMENT

The App Engine deployment is failing with this error:
```
ERROR: (gcloud.app.deploy) Error Response: [9] Cloud build [ID] status: FAILURE
```

## Solution: Direct Deployment (Bypass Cloud Build)

The issue is with Cloud Build failing. We can bypass Cloud Build completely with this command:

```bash
# While in the cloud shell
cd sloane-clean
gcloud app deploy minimal_app.yaml --no-cloud-build
```

This will deploy the application directly without using Cloud Build.

## If That Doesn't Work: New Project

There may be underlying issues with the project configuration. Create a fresh project:

1. Create a new project in Google Cloud Console
2. Enable App Engine API
3. Create a new App Engine application in the US Central region
4. Deploy using the command:
```bash
gcloud config set project [YOUR_NEW_PROJECT_ID]
gcloud app deploy minimal_app.yaml --no-cloud-build
```

## Final Option: Manual Deployment

If all else fails, you can deploy a simple App Engine application manually:

1. Create a file named `main.py` with this content:
```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return jsonify({"status": "online"})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)
```

2. Create a file named `app.yaml` with this content:
```yaml
runtime: python39
entrypoint: gunicorn -b :$PORT main:app
```

3. Create a file named `requirements.txt` with:
```
flask==2.3.3
gunicorn==21.2.0
```

4. Deploy with:
```bash
gcloud app deploy app.yaml --no-cloud-build
```

These options should bypass the Cloud Build issues completely and get your backend online.
